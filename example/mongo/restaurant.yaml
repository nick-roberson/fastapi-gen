# NOTES:
#   > If you want to generate your own config file from this one, honestly ChatGPT is a really good way to do it.
#   Just plug in this file and ask it to generate a .yaml file for you for other models or objects and it generally
#   does a pretty good job.
#   > Ids in alembic for example are integers, while in mongo they are strings. This is a good example of how the
#   database type can affect the model definitions.
